## Password Manager (Python, Tkinter)

This project is a desktop password manager built using **Python and Tkinter** as part of my learning journey in GUI development and application design.

### What I built

* A graphical password manager that stores website, email/username, and password details
* A password generator that creates strong, random passwords
* A clean user interface with form inputs, buttons, dialogs, and a structured layout
* A window background with a logo image and a white content area to improve readability

### What I studied and learned

* Building desktop applications using **Tkinter**
* Event-driven programming and button-based interactions
* Managing widget layout, layering, and UI structure
* Handling user input, validation, and confirmation dialogs
* File handling for saving persistent data
* Integrating external libraries such as **pyperclip** for clipboard functionality

### What I added and modified

* Refactored a console-based password generator into a GUI-based implementation
* Implemented error handling and user confirmation before saving data
* Added automatic clipboard copying for generated passwords
* Improved UI usability by separating background visuals from interactive components

This project strengthened my understanding of **Python GUI development**, user interaction design, and building practical applications from scratch.
