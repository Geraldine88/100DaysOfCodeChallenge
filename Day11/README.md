### Project

This project is a **Blackjack (21) game** played in the terminal.
The user plays against the computer (dealer) and tries to get a total as close to 21 as possible without going over.

### How the Program Works

* The user and computer are each dealt two cards.
* The user can choose to draw another card or stop.
* The computer automatically draws cards until its total is at least 17.
* The program compares totals and displays the result:

  * **YOU WIN**
  * **YOU LOSE**
  * **DRAW**

### Code Rules

* Using `random.choice()` to deal cards.
* Using lists to store player and computer cards.
* Using `sum()` to calculate the total card value.
* Using loops to allow the user to draw multiple times.
* Using functions to keep the code organized.
