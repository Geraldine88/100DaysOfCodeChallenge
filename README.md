My journey through the 100 Days of Code Python Challenge BootCamp
# 100 Days of Code – Python Challenge 

This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of Code: Python** challenge.
The goal of this challenge is to **improve my problem-solving skills, coding logic, and overall
confidence as a Python developer** through daily, consistent practice.

## Purpose of This Challenge
- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals
- Improve logical reasoning and algorithmic thinking
- Build real-world projects step by step
- Develop the habit of writing clean, readable code
- Track my progress publicly for accountability and growth

## Repository Structure
Each folder represents one day of the challenge:
Day1/
Day2/
Day3/
...
Day100/

Inside each folder, you’ll find:
- Python scripts for that day’s exercises or projects
- Occasionally a README explaining the concept or challenge for that day

## Progress
-  Day 1 Program: Band Name Generator
- Day 2 Program: Tip Calculator
- Day 3 Program: Choose Your Own Adventure Game
- Day 4 Program: Rock-Paper-Scissors
...

## Credits
This challenge follows the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu**.
All credit for the curriculum and project ideas goes to the instructor.
This repository reflects **my own solutions, modifications, experiments, and learning process**.

## Notes
Some solutions may not be optimal — this repository is meant to show **learning in progress**.
Improvements and refactors may be added as I grow.
