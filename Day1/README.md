What I Learned
Printing and Input:
=>How to print to the console and take user input.
=> String Manipulation by Practicing concatenating strings to create a band name.
=> Variables to store user input and manipulate them.


Project 
The Band Name Generator takes the user's input for their city and pet name to generate a unique band name. I could be any other variable important to an individual 


The program prompts the user for their city name and their pet's name.
It concatenates these inputs to create a band name in the format: "CityName PetName".
