# Coffee Machine Project
A simulation of a real‑world coffee vending machine using Python.
This project exists in two versions:
✔ Procedural Version
Built using loops, dictionaries, and manual logic.
I implemented:
• 	 drink selection
• 	resource tracking
• 	coin processing
• 	change calculation
• 	ingredient deduction
• 	machine shutdown
• 	report generation
✔ OOP Version
Built using classes from the Bootcamp:
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
This version taught me how to:
• 	work with objects
• 	pass objects between methods
• 	separate responsibilities
• 	follow a structured flow
#### Core Features
• 	Choose from espresso, latte, or cappuccino
• 	Check if resources are sufficient before taking money
• 	Accept coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
• 	Validate payment
• 	Return change
• 	Deduct ingredients
• 	Track profit
• 	Print machine reports
• 	Turn off the machine with 

## Turtle Graphics Practice
This section explores Python’s built‑in  module.
## What I built:
• 	Created a turtle named Nini
• 	Accessed the screen object
• 	Changed the turtle’s shape
• 	Changed the turtle’s color
• 	Moved the turtle forward
• 	Rotated the turtle
• 	Drew a circle
• 	Hid the turtle
• 	Closed the window on click
##  Concepts Practiced:
• 	Object instantiation (, )
• 	Method calls on objects
• 	Understanding attributes like  and 
• 	Basic graphics and movement
This helped me understand how Python objects behave visually and interactively.

## PrettyTable Practice
This section demonstrates how to install and use an external Python package.
🔧 Steps I practiced:
1. 	Installing a package in PyCharm
2. 	Importing a class from a package
3. 	Creating a table
4. 	Adding columns
5. 	Aligning text
6. 	Printing formatted output
## Example Output
A Pokémon table with names and types, left‑aligned for readability.
This exercise helped me understand:
• 	third‑party libraries
• 	class usage
• 	table formatting
• 	clean console output

##  What I Learned
✔ Python fundamentals
• 	loops
• 	conditionals
• 	dictionaries
• 	functions
• 	user input
• 	string methods
✔ Object‑Oriented Programming
• 	classes
• 	objects
• 	attributes
• 	methods
• 	passing objects between components
✔ External Libraries
• 	installing packages
• 	importing modules
• 	using class methods
✔ Graphics Programming
• 	working with the Turtle module
• 	understanding screen vs. turtle objects
• 	drawing shapes and moving objects
✔ Debugging & Logical Thinking
• 	fixing ordering issues
• 	preventing invalid states
• 	ensuring money isn’t taken when resources are insufficient
• 	reading error messages
• 	improving code structure
