# Turtle Projects: Etch-A-Sketch & Turtle Race


This repository explores Python’s turtle module to create interactive programs. It focuses on user-controlled turtle movement, event-driven programming, and basic game logic.

The project contains 2 exercises:

#### ** Etch-A-Sketch – Move a turtle using the keyboard to draw on the screen.**
#### **Turtle Race – A simple racing game where multiple turtles move across the screen, and the user can bet on the winner.**

### *Features*
#### **Etch-A-Sketch**

##### Control the turtle with keys:

**W – move forward**
**S – move backward**
**A – turn left**
**D – turn right**

**C – clear the screen and reset the turtle**

 - Real-time drawing with color customization (purple in this case)
 - Smooth heading adjustment for realistic turns


#### **Turtle Race**

- Multiple turtles race across the screen with randomized movement
- User can place a bet by selecting a turtle color
- The program announces the winner in a popup window
- Uses screen dimensions dynamically to position turtles automatically
- Allows clearing the screen and resetting after the race

### **What I Learned**

**Using turtle to create interactive graphics**

- Event-driven programming with onkey() and listen()
- Controlling turtle movement programmatically (forward, backward, turns)
- Creating simple game logic and handling user input
- Working with randomization to simulate racing 
- Clearing and resetting the screen with clear() and home()
- Dynamically positioning objects based on screen size 
- Incremental learning by breaking programs into small, reusable functions

### How to Run

1 - Clone the repository
2 - Open your Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm)
3 - Run one of the scripts:
    - etch_a_sketch.py 
    - turtle_race.py

Interact with the program using the keyboard or popups. Watch wise turtle play python!
