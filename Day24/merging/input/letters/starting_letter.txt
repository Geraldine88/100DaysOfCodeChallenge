INVITATION TO MY WEDDING

Dear [name],

It is with great joy and honor that I invite you to celebrate with me as I am joined in
Holy Matrimony with Prince Charming.

You have been an integral part of my life and growth process and truly appreciate you
that.

Inline with my motive to express my gratitude, I would also be honored if you graced my
blessed celebration with your esteemed presence at The Royal Palace, Zion Kingdom
777 ST, WEST RIVER SIDE, Heaven.

With great love and regards,

Geraldine Nnene.
