# Day 17 – Quiz Game (TRUE/ FALSE)

## Overview
In Day 17, I built a command-line **True/False Quiz Game** using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP). The project focuses on structuring code with classes and separating responsibilities across files. We train more on creating and using classes

## What I Learned
- How to create and use Python classes
- Initializing objects with `__init__`
- Managing game state (score and question number)
- Working with lists of objects
- Importing data from external files
- Looping through questions until the quiz ends

## Project Structure
- `data.py` – Stores quiz questions and answers
- `question_model.py` – Defines the `Question` class
- `quiz_brain.py` – Handles quiz logic and scoring
- `main.py` – Runs the quiz game

## How It Works
1. Questions are loaded into a question bank
2. The quiz asks questions one at a time
3. User answers are checked immediately
4. The final score is displayed at the end

## Skills Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data handling with dictionaries and lists
- Clean code organization
- Debugging logic errors
